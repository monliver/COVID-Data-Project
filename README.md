# COVID-Data-Project
This project involves developing a Java application to analyze data from text files, focusing on COVID-19 statistics, property values, and population data for Philadelphia. 

The application reads CSV and JSON files, processes the data, and performs various analyses, such as calculating vaccination rates and property values. It utilizes N-tier architecture, design patterns like Singleton and Strategy, and includes logging functionality. 

The project also requires implementing an additional feature that combines data from all three sources.
